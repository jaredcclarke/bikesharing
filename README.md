# Bike Sharing
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to use tableau to visualize New York City Citi Bike data, in order to convince invesotrs that it would be a good idea to have bikesharing in Des Moines, Iowa. The goal is to show how the NYC model could possibly translate to fit Des Moines by using Citi Bike data from August 2019.

### Resources & Tools
* Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3
* Python 3.9
* Tableau Public
* 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv

## Results
### Citi Bike Data
* Total Number of rides for August 2019: **2,344,224** 
* Total Number of Subscribers: **1,900,359** 
* Total Number of Customers (non-subscribers): **443,865**

* Males tend to use Citi Bike the most **1,530,272**, followed by females **588,431**, with unknowns **225,521** using the service the least
* Males and Females both tend to use Citi Bikes between **4 to 6 hours.**

* Males and Females tend to largely stop rides between **7 a.m. and 9 a.m. as well as 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.**

### Summary
* Based on the data, we can assume that the bikesharing program is mostly used by males, so it may be a good idea to set up bike sharing stations in places where a lot of males. 
* Also based on the data, it seems as if most riders use the bikes at times of the day when most people got to work and leave work, so could possibly have stations in a busy, traffic-heavy area. 
* Could possibly use the distance typically traveled by riders
* COuld visualize the average distacne per bike.
